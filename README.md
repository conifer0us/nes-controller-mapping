# NES HID Controller Keymapping

Software that can translate button presses on an NES HID controller to presses on a keyboard. It's my one-day scuffed solution to playing games with the controller.

There are predefined keymappings for my specific Hollow Knight and Celeste keyboard controls, but you can define dictionaries for different keymappings.

The keymapping variable defines the active dictionary that will be used. It's set by default to celeste since that's what I've been using it for. 

Also the DLL and virtual environment setup here are necessary for it to run since the program relies on a lot of outdated and weird software.
